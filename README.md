# Introduction

If the entire fleet is defeated, the player moves to the next level where all the statistics are increased. The player can lose his life if touched by an alien or he flies through the bottom.

# Controls

- Space-bar = Shoot
- Arrows keys = Move the ship left/right/top/down
- Q = Quit
